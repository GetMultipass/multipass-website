                    <h4>Do I need to pay for Multipass separately?</h4>
                    <p>
                        No. Your subscription includes the Multipass apps for
                        all members of your organization. There are no licenses
                        to keep track of &dash; you and your teammates can simply
                        download the apps from our website, and sign in to your

                    </p>

                    <h4>What platforms are supported by Multipass?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Teams using Google Suite are supported. Future support
                        for Office 365 is planned
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux is supported. Future
                        support for Safari and Edge is planned
                    </p>

                    <h4>What happens if my subscription lapses?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Don't worry, you will never be locked out of your
                        account or your data. If your subscription ends, your
                        account will be frozen but you will still be able to
                        access, view and export all your data.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How do I access priority support?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Subscribers to the Pro plan receive a special support
                        email address. This gives you access to the priority
                        support queue whenever you or anyone on your team needs
                        help.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Why Canâ€™t I start using Multipass immediately across my Organization?</h4>
                    <p>
                        When you invite new users to install Multipass, it waits
                        for invitees to install the extension before creating a
                        copy of the Group's private key. When the client
                        detects their public key, it'll then create a copy for
                        the user.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How does billing work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        We use a invoice-based subscription model that bills on
                        a per-user per-month basis. You only be billed when a
                        user actually opens the extensions during the billing
                        month. If a user does not use the extension, no line
                        item for that user is added to the invoice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, Alice uses Multipass on her domain with 3
                        other users for 4 total seats. Alice will be billed $5 per
                        user per month for a Pro plan. Therefore, after the first
                        month, Alice will be billed $20 and will receive an invoice
                        email explaining the user count and plan tier.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Why am I not getting billed for the first month after my free trial?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our invoice billing system bills you at the end of your
                        first month for the previous month's activity, so when
                        you sign up you will be billed $0.
